        <h2 class="header-font view-header">What is it?</h2>
        <p class="view-text normal-font">
            This was our intern section project. We were asked to make a game for the local library.
            The only restriction was to include pigs and that the facts were correct.
            We created a virtual detailed model from the library and put the player in as a robot.
            Pig gives players missions that make the player familiar with the library and its layout.
            <br><br>
            Picking a player also customizes book suggestions given by a pig,
            so a character playing as a princess robot is more likely to receive books about princesses.
            Pig also tells really corny jokes like: "What is the biggest rice in the world?" - "Paris"...
            Well, jokes work better in my native language.Controls were made simple and
            bright moving items were added to make the library more fun place.
