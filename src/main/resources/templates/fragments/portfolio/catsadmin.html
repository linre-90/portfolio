        <h2 class="header-font view-header">What was it?</h2>
        <p class="view-text normal-font">
            My first contact with WPF.
            I realized pretty quickly I needed some quick way to perform CRUD operations for blog posts,
            hot news sections and possible contact forms. At the beginning, I manipulated the database directly,
            but this was error-prone and slow, so let's make software to make it more simple and reliable.
            It made my life a lot easier. Program provided basic ui, CRUD operations, hot news and messages.

        <p class="view-text normal-font">
            The program did just what I needed. Simple, fast interface for managing blog content and
            other stuff related to the site. I considered a lot of different technology for this, like Ionic,
            Flutter, python and Electron but ended up with .net. I really did not need cross-platform compatibility and
            used Windows mainly, so it was an easy decision. The whole experience was actually pretty
            straight forward and pretty great. Although I still have things to learn in object-oriented programming.

            It was written in c#, packaged and installed. The program modified AWS bucket and Firebase firestore.
